[00:02.40] California love
[00:09.90] 
[00:14.23] California knows how to party
[00:16.55] California knows how to party
[00:19.74] In the city of LA
[00:27.69] In the city of good ol' Watts
[00:30.34] In the city, the city of Compton
[00:34.72] We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
[00:53.72] 
[00:45.94] Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
[00:48.81] A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
[00:52.69] The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
[00:54.08] Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
[00:57.82] We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
[00:58.93] The state where you never find a dance floor empty
[01:01.72] And pimps be on a mission for them greens
[01:04.22] Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
[01:27.22] 
[01:07.79] I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
[01:09.61] Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
[01:12.33] Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
[01:14.88] Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
[01:17.36] It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
[01:19.83] Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
[01:22.42] Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
[01:24.89] Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a
[01:42.89] 
[01:28.19] California knows how to party
[01:31.51] California knows how to party (yes, they do) (Westcoast)
[01:37.43] In the city of LA
[01:43.36] In the city of good ol' Watts

[02:21.85] Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
[02:25.40] Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
[02:28.19] Where cowards die and the strong ball
[02:30.93] Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
[02:33.77] In LA, we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
[02:35.70] Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
[02:38.47] Flossin' but have caution, we collide with other crews
[03:05.47] 
[02:41.38] Famous because we throw grams
[02:43.02] Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
[02:45.47] Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
[02:48.41] It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
[02:51.65] Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
[02:54.65] Let me serenade the streets of LA
[02:56.75] From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
[02:59.87] Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!
[03:26.37]
